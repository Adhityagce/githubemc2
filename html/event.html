            One of the important events in my life was when I was going with my parents to visit my aunt who lived in Canada. It was the first time I was going to board a plane. I was excited about the journey that I could not sleep the whole night. The next day I woke up my parents in excitement. We packed everything and left for the airport a few hours early than the flight time. We completed all the formalities, and it was time to go into the plane. I saw a plane for the first time, and it looked like a massive bird with its wings extended. I sat on the plane and sat on the window seat that belonged to my mother. As the plane took off, some people began to feel nauseous, but I was okay. I looked out the window, and the clouds seemed beautiful. Finally, after some hours, the plane touched the ground, and I was cheerful and happy!
