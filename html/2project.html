<p><h3>In this video, we'll discuss the advanced roadmap for full stack developers using the MERN stack. We'll cover topics such as React, Node.js, Express, MongoDB, and more. By the end of the video, you'll have a solid understanding of the MERN stack and how to use it to build full stack web applications.</p>
<p><h3>What's my story? An engineer, in love with his job, started teaching on the side. Got lucky. Impacted 1000s of lives. Had to finally leave his job to increase the impact surface area. Raised $5M funding to fix education. Is learning day and day about startups and building a valuable product. 

    How is it going? A decade of engineering helps in systems thinking and product building. Learning about Strategy, Marketing, People Management, and Finance on the go. 
    
    What am I building? Today, 25 million Indians prepare for government job entrance exams. They do it for years together. The probability of success is less than 1% but they still do it. Why? For the lack of a structured alternative to launch their white-collar career. I am building Invact to bridge this gap. 
    How? Follow me to know, it's a long story. I am telling it in parts every day.</h3></p>
